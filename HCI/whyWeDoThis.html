        Protecting the environment is important to reduce the destruction of ecosystems caused by a variety of anthropogenic activities. Protecting the environment from pollution and other activities that cause environmental degradation is more of an ethic for humans. Environmental destruction is harmful because it endangers the long-term health of animals, humans, and plants. Therefore, environmental education is necessary. Environmental education is a process that allows people to learn about environmental issues, solve problems, and take initiative to improve the environment. However, the process of environmental education can be time-consuming especially with various methods of doing so emerging recently. Nonetheless, this doesnâ€™t deny the fact that individuals should have a better understanding of environmental challenges and have the ability to make educated and responsible acts against the environment.
