                        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Avoiding deforestation completely is an uphill task. However, deforestation can be cut down and this can create an 
                            impressive way of reshaping and restoring forests and vegetation cover. As population grow, individuals can be sensitized and educated 
                            regarding sustainable forest management and reforestation efforts. Also, preserving the integrity of guarded areas can significantly reduce demonstration. 
                            Hence, there is a necessity for individuals all over the world to respect forest cover and reduce some of the human-driven actions that encourage logging. 
                            With the reduction of deforestation, soil's ability to naturally regenerate can be restored. Governments, international organizations and other 
                            environmental stakeholders need to ensure there are appropriate measures for making zero net deforestation a reality so as to inhibit soil degradation.

                        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Tillage means the preparation of land for growing crops, such as turning the soil. Proper tillage mechanisms hold as one of the most sustainable ways of avoiding soil quality decline. 
                            This is otherwise known as conservation tillage, which means tillage mechanisms targeted at making very minimal changes to the soil's natural condition and at the same 
                            time improving the soil's productivity. It creates a suitable soil environment for growing crop and that conserves soil, 
                            water and energy resources mainly throught the reduction in the intensity of tillage, and retention of plant residues. 
                            Examples include leaving the previous year's crop residue on the surface to shield the soil from erosion and 
                            avoiding poor tillage methods such as deep plowing.

                        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Just like the old saying goes "prevention is better than cure", so does the same concept apply in solving the worldwide problem of soil degradation through salinization. 
                            Salinization is the process by which water-soluble salts accumulate in the soil. The cost of preventting salinization are incredibly cheaper than the reclamation 
                            projects in salinized areas. Consequently, actions such as reducing irrigation, planting salt-tolerant crops, and improving irrigation efficientcy will have high payoffs because 
                            the inputs and the labor-demandinga aspects associated with reclamation projects are zero. Preventing salinization in the first place is thus an environmentally freindly means of offering a 
                            solution to soil degradation.
